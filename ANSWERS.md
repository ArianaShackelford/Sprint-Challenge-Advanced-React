- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    At this point class components are mainly considered legacy code so generally they would only get used when maintaining an app that uses them. With the updates to functional components being able to use hooks there is less need for them. 
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    Mounting (birth) - used to create and component and insert it into the DOM
    Updating (growth) - this happens when changes are made to props or state, the component re-renders
    Un-mounting (death) - this is used when you want to remove the component from the DOM
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    The purpose of a custom hook is to build and customize hooks to function for exactly what you need.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    Testing your app can help prevent bugs from making it into production code, and also can help us trust that our code is working as it should.
